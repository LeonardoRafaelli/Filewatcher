- **Settings:** Reset premium status, and change premium passwords
- **Intuitive UI:** User-friendly interface for a seamless monitoring experience.

## Design 📁

During the development of the FileWatcher, I was studying software usability in the Information System Programming Apprenticeship course. Therefore, the hole design was a match of trying to make the most usable and user-friendly screen, applying my new knowledges, and learning how to code with .NET.

- As I do like to move components around and find the best way to use it, we first created a prototype in Figma, than, we follow to the programming design with .xaml.
- We choose to use only two colors, a blue (#00579D) in contrast with a **white**.
